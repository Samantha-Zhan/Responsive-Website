# Responsive-Website
Here is a website I coded with HTML/CSS(SASS)/JS following online tutorial taught by [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow>DesignCourse&lt).


## Brief Description
The website is fully responsive and can auto-adjust for all screen sizes (at mobile, 768px, 1080px, 1450px). The website is built with "mobile-first" concept in mind and start from the smallest and gradually work towards larger screen sizes.
